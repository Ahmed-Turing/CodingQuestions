## `1` Overview

Assessment to complete on your own time. The assessment is divided into two sections: general questions and React
specific questions.

## `2` Testing Philosophy

A philosophy is a set of guiding principles. It provides a foundation for how the tests are created.
This philosophy is centered around being a practical technical assessment that tests the kinds of things you'd actually
be encountering on the job while allowing flexibility in language choice for general questions and focusing on React for
front-end related questions.

## `3` Rules for the Assessment

1. **Time Management**: Complete the assessment within the allocated time frame.
1. **Language Flexibility:** For the general questions, you are free to use any programming language you are comfortable
   with.
1. **Documentation**: Comment your code where necessary to explain your logic and approach. This helps to
   understand your thought process. Even if you don't finish a section, provide a brief explanation of what you would do
   or some pseudo code.
1. **Testing**: For the general questions, if you can, write and include tests for your code where applicable.
1. **Submission**: Fork the repository and open a pull request for your submission. Ensure all your code is committed and pushed before the deadline.
1. **Communication**: If you encounter any issues or have questions during the assessment, communicate promptly with the
   provided contact.
